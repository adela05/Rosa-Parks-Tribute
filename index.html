            <h3 id="headline">Life of Rosa Parks</h3>
            <p>Rosa Louise McCauley Parks was an American civil rights activist, whom the
              United States Congress called "the first lady of civil rights" and "the mother of the freedom movement".
              Her birthday, February 4, and the day she was arrested, December 1, have both become Rosa Parks Day,
              commemorated in California and Missouri (February 4), and Ohio and Oregon (December 1).
              On December 1, 1955, in Montgomery, Alabama, Parks refused to obey bus driver James F. Blake's order
              to give up her seat in the colored section to a white passenger, after the white section was filled. Parks was
              not the first person to resist bus segregation. Others had taken similar steps, including Bayard Rustin in 1942,
              Irene Morgan in 1946, Sarah Louise Keys in 1952, and the members of the ultimately successful Browder v.
              Gayle 1956 lawsuit (Claudette Colvin, Aurelia Browder, Susie McDonald, and Mary Louise Smith) who were
              arrested in Montgomery for not giving up their bus seats months before Parks. NAACP organizers believed that
              Parks was the best candidate for seeing through a court challenge after her arrest for civil disobedience in
              violating Alabama segregation laws, although eventually her case became bogged down in the state courts while
              the Browder v. Gayle case succeeded.</p>
              <p>Parks' act of defiance and the Montgomery Bus Boycott became important symbols of the modern
                Civil Rights Movement. She became an international icon of resistance to racial segregation. She organized
                and collaborated with civil rights leaders, including Edgar Nixon, president of the local chapter of the NAACP;
                and Martin Luther King, Jr., a new minister in town who gained national prominence in the civil rights
                movement.
                At the time, Parks was secretary of the Montgomery chapter of the NAACP. She had recently attended the
                Highlander Folk School, a Tennessee center for training activists for workers' rights and racial equality. She
                acted as a private citizen "tired of giving in". Although widely honored in later years, she also suffered for her act;
                she was fired from her job as a seamstress in a local department store, and received death threats for years
                afterwards. Her situation also opened doors.</p>
                <p>Shortly after the boycott, she moved to Detroit, where she briefly found similar work. From 1965 to 1988
                  she served as secretary and receptionist to John Conyers, an African-American US Representative. She was
                  also active in the Black Power movement and the support of political prisoners in the US.
                  After retirement, Parks wrote her autobiography and continued to insist that the struggle for justice was
                  not over and there was more work to be done. In her final years, she suffered from dementia. Parks received
                  national recognition, including the NAACP's 1979 Spingarn Medal, the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the
                  Congressional Gold Medal, and a posthumous statue in the United States Capitol's National Statuary Hall.
                  Upon her death in 2005, she was the first woman and third non-US government official to lie in honor at the
                  Capitol Rotunda.</p>
